# Controller

You can create a custom embed and button for the Music Controller in Vocard for each guild. This Music Controller displays the current playback status, including details like whether a track is looping and the number of songs in the queue. Additionally, the controller buttons allow you to perform actions such as pause, skip, forward, rewind, and go back, eliminating the need to type commands.

### Buttons
This documentation provides a detailed breakdown of the custom button configuration in our application.

#### Button Styles
Each style serves a different purpose and can be used to convey the button's function more effectively. For more details on button styles, refer to the [Discord ButtonStyle Documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactions/api.html?highlight=button%20style#discord.ButtonStyle)

| Style Name | Description |
| --------------------------- | --- |
| Grey | A neutral color that blends well with most themes, ideal for secondary actions. |
| Red | A bold color that signifies danger or stop actions, used for critical functions like stopping or disconnecting. |
| Blurple | A vibrant blue hue that attracts attention, suitable for primary actions like play or start. |
| Green | Represents success or positive actions. |

#### Button Types
We categorize buttons into three types for easier understanding: `normal buttons`, `state-based buttons`, and `full-width select buttons`.

1. Normal Buttons
    
    Normal buttons are simple and can include an emoji, label, and optional style. Here are the details:

    | Back | Skips back to the previous song. |
    | Skip | Skips to the next song. |
    | Stop | Disconnects the bot from your voice channel and chears the queue. |
    | Forward | Forward 30 seconds in the current track. | |
    | VolumeUp | Increase player volume by 20%. |
    | VolumeDown | Decrease player volume by 20%. |
    | Autoplay | Enable or disable autoplay mode. |
    | Shuffle | Randomizes the tracks in the queue. |
    | Rewind | Rewind 30 seconds in the current track. |
    | Lyrics | Show the lyrics of the current track in an embedded message. |

            {
                "back": {
                    "emoji": "‚èÆÔ∏è",
                    "label": "@@t_buttonBack@@",

                    }
                }
            }
        ]
        ```

                    }
                }
            }
        ]
        ```

3. Full-Width Select Buttons
